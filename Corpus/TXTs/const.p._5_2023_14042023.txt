C.M.A. NO.2600 OF 2023 IN Const. P. 05/2023                                                                                    2 
 
 
 
 
Finance/Finance Division and the Commission, as well as the

with our direction, the Acting Governor, State Bank of 
Pakistan (“State Bank”) presented to the Court a statement 
setting out the funds and monies of the Federation/Federal

following effect:

The Acting Governor explained that these amounts 
constituted the Federal Consolidated Fund (“Fund”). The 
amount lying in Account No.I (Non-Food) (“Account I”) 
constitutes by far the largest component of the Fund (being 
98.77% thereof as of the date for which the data was 
provided). It was further explained that the amount lying in 
Account I is not designated for any particular or special usage 
whatsoever. Furthermore, the funds therein are not static 
C.M.A. NO.2600 OF 2023 IN Const. P. 05/2023                                                                                    3 
 
 
 
 
inasmuch as there are regular (it seems almost daily) inflows 
into, and outflows therefrom, as Government receipts flow in, 
and monies are released to meet Government expenditures. 
The Acting Governor stated that other than Account I, the 
other 16 accounts were for special and designated purposes, 
carrying different amounts as set out in the table above.  
 
2.  
 
It was explained to the Acting Governor that as per 
para 5 of the order dated 04.04.2023 made in Constitution 
Petition No.5 of 2023 (“Order”), a sum of Rs.21 Billion was 
required for the purposes of general elections to the Punjab 
and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assemblies and it was queried as 
to whether this sum could be made available from the funds 
aforementioned of the Federal Government lying with and 
under the custody, control and management of the State 
Bank, with particular reference to Account I. The Acting 
Governor confirmed that this would be done if the Court so 
directed and ordered. The State Bank further confirmed that 
the necessary transaction for the transfer of funds to the 
Commission, so that Rs.21 Billion become immediately 
available and utilizable for the latter, could be done within the 
shortest possible time, and at the latest by the close of 
business on Monday i.e. 17.04.2023. 
 
3. 
 
The team from the Ministry of Finance/Finance 
Division (“Finance”) was led by the Special Secretary, 
Mr.Awais Manzur Sumra. The Secretary, with the assistance 
of the learned Attorney General, also gave a presentation to 
C.M.A. NO.2600 OF 2023 IN Const. P. 05/2023                                                                                    4 
 
 
 
 
the Court, in broad terms, with regard to the financial 
position of the Government of Pakistan, with particular 
reference also to the present and/or pending international 
obligations to the IMF. From the figures presented to the 
Court, of which even the smallest ran to several hundreds of 
Billions of Rupees, it became clear that the disbursement of 
Rs.21 Billion for fulfilling the constitutional mandate of 
holding the general elections would, at most, amount to a 
minuscule increase in the obligations of the Federal 
Government. 
Indeed, 
viewed 
from 
certain 
financial 
perspectives and contexts, which were stated by the team 
from Finance, the amount would be so insignificant as to not 
even amount to a rounding off error. The team from Finance 
also informed the Court that the Federal Government 
regularly went into the bond markets to borrow and raise 
funds which in the aggregate in any given financial year ran 
into trillions of Rupees. It was stated that in this regard 
Treasury bills were issued by the State Bank on behalf of the 
Federal Government on a regular and ongoing basis and that, 
even in this perspective, taking the amount now under 
consideration into account would not have any meaningful 
impact or effect. It was also confirmed by Finance that if the 
Court so ordered and directed the process of making the 
funds to the tune of Rs. 21 Billion available to the 
Commission on an immediately utilizable basis would be 
concluded rapidly, and by the close of business on 
17.04.2023.  
C.M.A. NO.2600 OF 2023 IN Const. P. 05/2023                                                                                    5 
 
 
 
 
 
4. 
 
In our view, on an assessment of the presentations 
made by the State Bank and the Finance Ministry/Division, 
there can be no doubt that the Rs.21 Billion required by the 
Commission and ordered to be made available in terms of 
para 5 of the Order can be done immediately and within a 
matter of a day. As to the exact mechanism for the transfer, 
the team from the Commission, ably led by the Secretary Mr. 
Omar Hamid Khan explained that the funds made available to 
and utilized by the Commission lay with AGPR. That agency 
had allocated an ID number (bearing No.2826) for the funds 
available to the Commission. To this ID number there is 
associated a ceiling determined by the Finance Division and 
within that ceiling the funds allocated to the aforesaid ID 
number are readily and immediately available to and 
utilizable by the Commission. Of course, as expected and 
confirmed by the Election Commission, any utilization of any 
funds whatsoever would be for the specific and properly 
assigned purpose (here the holding of general elections to the 
Punjab and KP Assemblies) and always in terms of the 
applicable accounting rules and procedure, and ultimately 
subject also to proper audit. It was further confirmed to the 
Court by all the officials and teams that on its order, the State 
Bank would send an appropriate communication to the 
Finance Division to the effect that Rs.21 Billion from Account 
I stood allocated to the Commission for purposes of the 
general elections as aforesaid and that the Finance Division 
would then immediately send an appropriate communication 
C.M.A. NO.2600 OF 2023 IN Const. P. 05/2023                                                                                    6 
 
 
 
 
(on the same day) to the AGPR directing it to raise the ceiling 
of the limit associated with ID No.2826 by Rs. 21 Billion. In 
this way the Election Commission would immediately have 
access to, and be able to utilize, the said funds for purposes 
of the general elections.  
 
5. 
 
With the assistance of the learned Attorney 
General and the team from the Finance, the Court also 
examined the relevant provisions of the Constitution relating 
to the allocation of these funds. It was confirmed by the 
officials of the Finance Ministry that in terms of Article 84 of 
the 
Constitution, 
the 
Federal 
Government 
was 
fully 
authorized 
to 
make 
expenditures 
from 
the 
Federal 
Consolidated Fund for, inter alia, “expenditure upon some 
new service not included in the Annual Budget Statement” for 
the relevant financial year here being the year ending on 
30.06.2023. For such expenditure the Federal Government 
obtains ex post facto approval and authorization from the 
National Assembly in terms of the procedure laid down in the 
Articles of the Constitution immediately preceding Article 84. 
On a consideration of all of the foregoing it is our view that 
there is absolutely no difficulty or hitch, either financially or 
procedurally or in terms of the relevant authorization by and 
under the Constitution, for the immediate release of Rs.21 
Billion 
to 
the 
Election 
Commission 
for 
fulfilling 
its 
constitutional mandate for the holding of general elections to 
the Punjab and KP Assemblies.  
 
C.M.A. NO.2600 OF 2023 IN Const. P. 05/2023                                                                                    7 
 
 
 
 
6. 
 
In view of the foregoing, it is hereby ordered and 
directed as follows: 
i) 
The State Bank of Pakistan shall from 
Account I lying under its control and 
management (and which constitutes the 
principal 
component 
of 
the 
Federal 
Consolidated Fund) forthwith allocate and 
release Rs. 21 Billion for purposes of the 
general elections to the Punjab and KP 
Assemblies. The State Bank shall in this 
regard immediately send an appropriate 
communication to the Finance Ministry/ 
Division. The said Ministry/ Division shall 
forthwith and immediately issue a proper 
direction to the AGPR to increase the limit of 
the ceiling with respect to the Election 
Commission’s ID No.2826 by the said sum of 
Rs.21 Billion. This 
position shall also 
immediately be confirmed to the Election 
Commission by the said Ministry/ Division 
which shall also ensure that AGPR also 
forthwith 
gives 
proper 
intimation 
and 
confirmation to the Election Commission. All 
this must be done at the earliest and at the 
absolute latest not later than the close of 
business on Monday i.e. 17.04.2023. In this 
manner, the sum of Rs.21 Billion shall be 
C.M.A. NO.2600 OF 2023 IN Const. P. 05/2023                                                                                    8 
 
 
 
 
and become available to and with the 
Election 
Commission 
in 
immediately 
releasable and utilizable funds for the 
purposes of holding the general elections to 
the Punjab and KP Assemblies. All the 
entities mentioned above i.e. the State Bank, 
Finance Ministry/Division, AGPR and the 
Election Commission must act together and 
coordinate fully so that the order and 
direction of the Court is implemented within 
the stipulated timeframe.  
ii) 
The State Bank and the Finance Ministry/ 
Division shall by 18.04.2023 file compliance 
reports with this Court to the effect that 
order of the Court has been complied with, 
and the report of the Finance Ministry/ 
Division shall also include a confirmation in 
relation to AGPR. Likewise, the Election 
Commission shall on 18.04.2023 file a report 
with this Court confirming that Rs.21 Billion 
have become available to it in terms as 
stated above. We may also note that this 
order shall be deemed sufficient authority for 
all 
purposes 
for 
the 
authorization 
of 
expenditure on the Federal Consolidated 
Fund and the Federal Government shall 
thereupon obtain the ex post facto approval 
C.M.A. NO.2600 OF 2023 IN Const. P. 05/2023                                                                                    9 
 
 
 
 
and sanction from the National Assembly for 
authorisation of this expenditure in terms of 
Article 84 and other applicable provisions of 
the Constitution. 
 
7. 
 
We would like to record our appreciation for the 
assistance that was provided to the Court by each of the 
officials that appeared today and the respective teams led by 
them.  This matter stands adjourned for the purposes of para 
5 of the Order but should any need arise it will be taken up 
again in such terms as deemed appropriate by the Court. 
Insofar as the matters identified in paras 6 and 7 of the 
Order, those matters will be taken up once the report 
required to be filed by the Federal Government in terms of 
para 6 thereof has been filed and considered by the Election 
Commission.
