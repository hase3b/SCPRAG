Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, J:- The legal question before 
us is as to whether the powers of the Commissioner under Section 
122(5A) of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 (“Ordinance”) can be 
delegated to the Additional Commissioner Inland Revenue under 
Section 210 of the Ordinance. 
2. 
 
Brief facts of the case are that the petitioner furnished 
its income tax return for the tax year 2013, which was deemed as 
an assessment order under Section 120 of the Ordinance. 
Subsequently, a show cause notice was issued to the petitioner on 
16.01.2014 by the Additional Commissioner Inland Revenue under 
Section 122(5A) of the Ordinance, along with notice dated 
16.04.2014 under Section 122(9) of the Ordinance. The deemed 
assessment order was then amended vide order dated 28.02.2014. 
Aggrieved of the same, the petitioner filed an appeal before the 
CP No. 6-L/2023 
 
 
 
Commissioner Inland Revenue, Appeal-I, Lahore which was partly 
allowed vide order dated 16.06.2014, however, with regards to the 
legal question before us, it was dismissed. Both the petitioner and 
the department then filed cross appeals before the Appellate 
Tribunal Inland Revenue, Lahore, which were disposed of on 
merits vide order dated 09.06.2022, however, on the legal question 
mentioned above, the appeal of the petitioner was again dismissed. 
The petitioner then filed an Income Tax Reference under Section 
133 of the Ordinance and articulated the above legal question in 
the following manner: 
I. 
Whether the Tribunal was correct in law in endorsing 
assumption of jurisdiction 
by 
[the] 
Additional 
Commissioner under section 122(5A) of the Income 
Tax Ordinance? 
II. 
Whether [the] legal obligation of “consideration” 
imposed by the legislature on [the] Commissioner in 
section 122(5A) of [the] Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 
can be delegated to any other authority below the 
rank of a Commissioner? 
The Income Tax Reference was decided against the petitioner vide 
the impugned judgment dated 20.10.2022, hence, the instant 
petition for leave to appeal.   
3. 
 
The learned counsel for the petitioner has argued that 
the deemed assessment is made under Section 120 of the 
Ordinance by the Commissioner and the amendment under 
Section 122(5A) of the Ordinance is based on the said assessment 
if it is considered that it is erroneous or prejudicial to the interest 
of revenue, and therefore, only the Commissioner could amend the 
said order in terms of Section 122(5A) of the Ordinance and the 
said power cannot be delegated to the Additional Commissioner. 
He further submits that the discretion of the Commissioner to 
“consider” that the assessment order is erroneous in so far as it 
prejudicial to the interest of revenue cannot be delegated. 
4. 
 
On the other hand, the learned counsel for the 
department submits that the authority to delegate the powers of 
the Commissioner under Section 122(5A) is specifically provided 
CP No. 6-L/2023 
 
 
 
for under Section 210(1A) of the Ordinance and further refers to 
Section 211 of the Ordinance to point out that the powers and 
functions of the Commissioner delegated under Section 210 of the 
Ordinance shall be treated as having been exercised and performed 
by the Commissioner. He also referred to the definition of 
“Commissioner” provided in Section 2(13) of the Ordinance which 
includes any other authority vested with all or any of the powers or 
functions of the Commissioner. Therefore, according to the learned 
counsel, under Section 210 of the Ordinance the powers of the 
Commissioner can be delegated to the Additional Commissioner 
Inland Revenue, the exercise of which would be treated as having 
been exercised and performed by the Commissioner. 
5. 
 
We have heard the learned counsel for the parties and 
have gone through the impugned judgment of the High Court and 
the record of the case. The only question that requires 
determination is as to whether the powers exercised by the 
Commissioner under Section 122(5A) of the Ordinance to amend or 
further amend an assessment order, if he considers that the 
assessment order is erroneous in so far as it is prejudicial to the 
interest of the revenue, could be delegated to the Additional 
Commissioner under Section 210 of the Ordinance. The answer to 
the said question can be ascertained simply through a conjunctive 
reading of Sections 2(13), 122(5A), 210 and 211 of the Ordinance. 
6. 
 
 Section 122(5A) of the Ordinance stipulates that 
subject to sub-section (9), which requires that the taxpayer must 
be provided with an opportunity to be heard, the Commissioner 
may amend, or further amend, an assessment order if he considers 
the assessment order as erroneous is so far as it is prejudicial to 
the interest of revenue. Section 210(1) of the Ordinance specifically 
empowers the Commissioner to delegate all or any of the powers or 
functions conferred upon or assigned to the Commissioner under 
the Ordinance to any officer of Inland Revenue subordinate to the 
Commissioner, except the power of delegation. Importantly, Section 
210(1A) removes any ambiguity as to the power of the 
Commissioner to delegate his powers provided under Section 
122(5A) by stipulating that the Commissioner shall not delegate 
CP No. 6-L/2023 
 
 
 
the powers of the amendment of assessment contained in Section 
122(5A) to an officer of Inland Revenue below the rank of 
Additional Commissioner Inland Revenue. Section 211(1) of the 
Ordinance then further fortifies that where by virtue of an order 
under Section 210 of the Ordinance, an officer of the Inland 
Revenue exercises a power or performs a function of the 
Commissioner, such power or function shall be treated as having 
been exercised or performed by the Commissioner. This is further 
aided 
by 
Section 
2(13) 
of 
the 
Ordinance 
which 
defines 
“Commissioner” as a person appointed as such under Section 208 
and includes any other authority vested with all or any of the 
powers and functions of the Commissioner.  
7. 
 
The learned counsel for the petitioner has attempted to 
interpret and read the above provisions in isolation and has argued 
that 
as 
a 
general 
principle 
of 
propriety, 
the 
Additional 
Commissioner, being junior to the Commissioner, cannot revise an 
order passed by the Commissioner. We are afraid that we cannot 
agree with the said submission of the counsel in view of the above 
clear provisions of the Ordinance. The legislature has specifically 
empowered the Commissioner under Section 210 of the Ordinance 
to delegate all or any of the powers or functions conferred upon 
him under the Ordinance, other than the power of delegation, to 
any officer of Inland Revenue subordinate to him. Any ambiguity 
regarding delegation of the powers provided under Section 122(5A) 
is clearly dealt with under Section 210(1A) of the Ordinance which 
specifically provides that the said powers to amend an assessment 
order cannot be delegated to an officer of Inland Revenue below the 
rank of Additional Commissioner Inland Revenue. Section 211(1) of 
the Ordinance then declares and affirms that where an officer of 
Inland Revenue exercises or performs such delegated powers or 
functions, such power or function shall be treated as having been 
performed by the Commissioner himself. This is further supported 
by the definition of “Commissioner” provided in Section 2(13), as 
pointed out above. It is well settled that a literal approach is to be 
adopted while interpreting fiscal or taxing statutes, and the Court 
cannot read into or impute something when the provisions of a 
CP No. 6-L/2023 
 
 
 
taxing statute are clear. While interpreting a taxing statute, the 
Court must look to the words of the statute and interpret it in light 
of what is clearly expressed therein, and it cannot imply something 
which is not expressed or import provisions in the statute so as to 
support any assumed deficiency.1  
8. 
 
According to De Smith’s Judicial Review2, even 
though, based on the maxim delegatus non potest delegare3, it is a 
general principle of public law that where the legislature vests 
powers in a person, indicating that trust is being placed in his 
individual judgment and discretion, that person is prima facie 
required to exercise that power personally, however, the said 
principle is not absolute and yields to the language, scope and 
object of the statute conferring the said powers. A legislation may 
expressly provide for a statutory procedure to delegate such 
powers vested in an administrative authority, after the exercise of 
which, the delegate can then exercise the delegated power in their 
own right. The above express provisions in the Ordinance clearly 
allow the Commissioner to delegate his functions and powers, 
which includes the power to “consider” and decide, under Section 
122(5A) to the Additional Commissioner, and consequently, they 
must be read as such. Therefore, the argument of the learned 
counsel for the petitioner with regards to delegation of the 
discretion of the Commissioner is devoid of force. 
9. 
 
We have also observed that the question of law raised 
in the instant petition has also already been dealt with by a 3-
Member Bench of this Court in an unreported judgment rendered 
in The Bank of Punjab4, wherein the assumption of jurisdiction by

3 A delegate may not delegate to another the power which has been delegated to 
them. 
4 The Bank of Punjab v. The Commissioner Inland Revenue, CA Nos. 1669 to 
1692 of 2013, decided on 06.02.2019. We have noted with concern that the 
learned counsel for the petitioner had also appeared for the petitioner in the said 
case, however, he did not bring this to our notice at the time of arguing the 
matter. 
CP No. 6-L/2023 
 
 
 
the Additional Commissioner under Section 122(5A), through 
delegation, has been affirmed. The said judgment upholds the view 
taken by the various High Courts in Pak Telecom5, Pakistan 
Tobacco6 and Shell7. It was also noted therein that a redressive 
remedy against an order passed by the Additional Commissioner 
under Section 122(5A) is available under Section 127 of the 
Ordinance before the Commissioner (Appeals), therefore, there is 
no prejudice caused to an aggrieved party. Consequently, the said 
judgment, being binding, also settles the matter and must be 
adhered to, including for the reasons provided for therein. 
10. 
 
In view of the above, we see no reason to interfere in 
the well-reasoned order of the High Court. Therefore, leave is 
refused and this petition is dismissed.
