Rashid/ Meher LC
Const. P-21/2022

Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, J.- Even though we have been
hearing this case since 19 July 2022 but after the 46 hearing of the case
held on 16 March 2023, the Parliament enacted the Supreme Court
(Practice and Procedure) Act 2023 (“Act”) on 21 April 2023! which, inter
alia, requires under Section 3 that the Bench for hearing petitions under
Article 184(3) of the Constitution is to be constituted by a Committee
comprising of the Chief Justice of Pakistan and two next most senior
Judges of the Court. Section 4 provides that any case involving the
interpretation of constitutional provision is to be heard by a Bench

comprising atleast of five Judges.

2. The next hearing in this case after the promulgation of the
Act was scheduled to be held on 16 May 2023. Before the said hearing, I
apprised the Hon’ble Chief Justice of Pakistan of my reservations to
continue with hearing the case by the present Bench (as expressed in this
note). The case was therefore simply adjourned on that date. My
understanding was that the present case would be taken up for further
hearing only after the constitutionality of the Act is finally decided by this
Court. However, this case has been fixed for hearing today, and there is
no date of hearing fixed in the other case? that will determine the

constitutionality of the Act.

3. The Act being a procedural law also applies to pending cases
under Article 184(3) of the Constitution, including the present one. I am
aware that the operation of the Act has been suspended by an eight-
member Bench of this Court. It is, however, clear that the suspension
order of the eight-member Bench is an interim measure. If ultimately the
Court upholds the constitutional validity of the Act, which is an equally
possible outcome with that of the possible decision of its constitutional
invalidity, the Act would take effect from the date of its enforcement, not
from the date of decision of the Court. In case the Act is held to be valid,
the decision of this Bench, which is not constituted as per the procedure
prescribed and strength of Judges required under the Act, in the present
matter, may arguably be coram non judice and thus a nullity in the eye of

law.

4. In order to avoid such an anomaly, I was of the view that the

cases under Article 184(3) of the Constitution should not be heard till the

' which was suspended by this Court on 13.04.2023 when it was still a Bill.
2? Raja Amer Khan v Federation of Pakistan (C.P, 6/2023), etc.
a

Const.P-21/2022

case dealing with the constitutional validity of the Act is decided, or if some
urgency requires that a case under Article 184(3) of the Constitution must
be heard, it would be prudent and appropriate if it is heard by a Full Court
Bench. That is why | recorded my opinion in Const. Petitions No.24-26 of
2023 (Trial of Civilians in Military Courts case) on 22 June 2023 thus:

I am of the opinion that until this Court decides the constitutionality of
the Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure) Act 2023, Section 3 of which
has prescribed the procedure for invoking original jurisdiction of this
Court under Article 184(3) of the Constitution, all such matters under this
jurisdiction must be heard by the Full Court Bench of this Court.

I, therefore, made a request today to the Hon’ble Chief Justice of Pakistan
on the Bench to constitute a Full Court Bench, for hearing the present

case, which I hope his lordship would consider earnestly.

5. Despite the above, in all fairness to the parties of this case, I
also consider it appropriate to give an opportunity to them to assist the
Court on the question whether this Bench should continue hearing this
case or should this case be adjourned till the Court first decides the
constitutionality of the Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure) Act, 2023
or in the alternate, should a Full Court Bench hear this case pending
decision on constitutionality of the Act. Learned Counsel for the parties
are to come prepared on the next date’ to address the Court on this

question.
