2. From the aforegoing observa

is declared as their
r having received

erms of 1° Proviso

Speaker, it appears that reliance has been placed on the order dated

17.05.2022 made in C -P. No.2/2022 and Reference No.1/2022 by 4
larger Bench of this Court. The view expressed by the Deputy Speaker
this Court in

does not give or pinpoint the precise observation made by

its aforesaid order on which reliance has been placed.

unsel for the Petitioner has read to us from

3. Learned Co
Article 63-A (1)(b) of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of
Pakistan, 1973 to submit that the direction to members is to be issued

by the parliamentary party to which they, in this case MPAs, belong.

He has read from para 3 of our judgment dated 17.05.2022 to submit
that the direction has to, and can only, be given by the parliamentary
r hand, the impugned Deputy Speaker's ruling

party itself. On the othe

Const. P.NO. 22 OF 2022

Accordingly, notice is issued to him. Notice shall also be issued to
Respondents No.2 & 3 as questions of constitutional import, mainly in
relating to Article 63-A(1)(b) read with our judgment dated 17.05.2022,
arise for determination, We would also issue notice under Order XXVILA
CPC to the Attorney Gencral for Pakistan and the Advocate General,
Punjab.

4. The matter in issue seems more likely to be a controversy
regarding the proper understanding or comprehension of the
statement of law in our aforesaid judgment rather than of an
interpretation as such of a Constitutional provision. However, we
expect valuable assistance to be given to us by the respondents in
defence of the ruling given by the Deputy Speaker dated 22.07.2022.
The Deputy Speaker shall attend these proceedings personally and
shall bring the record of the proceedings of the election and the

matters in issuc. This petition shall be taken up at 2.30 p.m. today.
