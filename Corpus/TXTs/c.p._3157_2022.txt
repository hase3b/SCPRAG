JUDGMENT 
 
 
MUHAMMAD ALI MAZHAR, J. The aforesaid Civil Petitions for 
leave to appeal are directed against the common Judgment dated 
21.05.2022, passed by learned Federal Service Tribunal, Islamabad 
(“Tribunal”) whereby Service Appeals No. 305 (R) to 313 (R) 
CS/2020 were allowed with the directions to the department to 
take steps for grant of move-over to the appellants (respondents 
herein) from the date on which they became eligible.   
  
C.Ps.No.3157 to 3165/2022 
-2- 
 
2. The short-lived facts of the case are that the respondents were 
performing their duties in the Population Welfare Department. 
After retirement, they were allowed proforma promotion from BPS-
17 to BPS-18 and BPS 18 to BPS-19 in compliance with the 
judgments of the learned Tribunal dated 23.10.2008 and 
09.07.2010, and the Judgments of this Court dated 30.06.2009 
and 24.11.2010. However, the respondents claimed the entitlement 
of move-over w.e.f. 01.12.2000 on the notion that they had reached 
the maximum stage of pay scale on 01.12.1999. Their request was 
forwarded to the concerned Ministry and thereafter, the Move-Over 
Committee (“Committee”) was constituted and a meeting was 
convened on 31.07.2019. After discussion, the Committee decided 
that the respondents are not entitled for grant of move-over as 
requested by them and the decision of the Committee was 
communicated accordingly. Being aggrieved, the respondents filed 
representations to the department which were rejected; thereafter 
the respondents approached the learned Tribunal where their 
appeals were allowed. 
 
3. The learned Addl. A.G.P, argued that the learned Tribunal failed 
to consider the record with proper application of mind and reached 
an erroneous conclusion. It was further averred that the 
respondents were not regularly promoted, hence they were not 
entitled to the benefit of move-over. It was further contended that 
the learned Tribunal ignored that the cause of action arose to the 
respondents in the year 2000, but the appeal was filed in the year 
2020 without giving any plausible explanation for the delay. 
 
4. Heard the arguments. The bone of contention between the 
petitioner and private respondents is whether, before the proforma 
promotion, the respondents had already reached the maximum 
stage of BPS-19 and, hence, were entitled for grant of move-over to 
BPS-20. The controversy triggered when, on 19.11.2019, a 
memorandum was communicated to the respondents with regard 
to the decision arrived at in the meeting of the Committee from 
BPS-19 to BPS-20 to the ex-employees of the defunct M/o 
Population Welfare Department, whereby they were denied the 
benefit of move-over from BPS-19 to BPS-20. The minutes of 
meeting are on record which demonstrate a duly incorporated table 
showing the names of respondents at Serial Nos.1 to 6 and 9 to 11 
C.Ps.No.3157 to 3165/2022 
-3- 
 
(Appellants before the Tribunal), and in Paragraph No. 3 of the 
same minutes of meeting it is noticeably and unambiguously 
elucidated that the AGPR, Accounts offices, Punjab and KPK have 
confirmed that the officers mentioned in the minutes of the 
meeting had already reached maximum of BPS-19 before the date 
of their proforma promotion, hence they are entitled for grant of 
move-over to BPS-20 but said recommendations were not accepted 
by the Committee and, in Paragraph No. 6, certain  observations 
were made that proforma promotions were granted under the 
directions of the Courts as in some cases juniors were granted 
proforma promotion and on the basis of this wrong act a large 
number of petitioners accrued their right for promotion. Seemingly, 
the Committee rejected the request of move-over with the 
resentment and exasperation that the proforma promotion was 
granted under the orders of the Courts which displeased them and, 
instead of deciding the issue of move-over on its merits, the 
request was turndown without proper application of mind which 
deprived the respondents of their right of move-over which accrued 
before the date of proforma promotion.  
 
5. It is a well settled exposition of law that a move-over cannot be 
construed as promotion to the post of higher Basic Pay Scale, but 
the higher pay scale is treated to be an extension of the existing 
Basic Pay Scale of the post held by the employee. Though the 
Government Policy for extending move-over was discontinued 
which has also been mentioned by the learned Tribunal with the 
cutoff date as 01.07.2002, but the fact remains that the 
respondents 
were 
not 
claiming 
their 
move-over 
after 
its 
discontinuation or revision of the policy but they were pursuing 
the entitlement of proforma promotion accrued in the next higher 
grade before the cut-off date. If an employee was not promoted and 
meanwhile reached to the maximum stage of his pay scale then 
obviously, he could be stagnant in his earlier pay scale due to 
attainment of maximum stage, therefore, as per erstwhile move-
over Policy, the modus of move-over was devised to cope with such 
situations in accordance with the criteria provided under SI.No.73 
to SI.No.91, (O.M. 1975 to 1999) incorporated in the Establishment 
Code 2007. The respondents were deprived of the benefit vide 
memorandum dated 19.11.2019 and being aggrieved, they 
C.Ps.No.3157 to 3165/2022 
-4- 
 
approached to the learned Tribunal for relief, thus we do not 
subscribe the arguments of the learned Additional Attorney 
General that the appeals were time barred before the learned 
Tribunal which plea has already been dealt with adequately by the 
Tribunal in the impugned judgment.  
  
6. If a person is not considered due to any administrative slip-up, 
error or delay when the right to be considered for promotion is 
matured and without such consideration, he reaches to the age of 
superannuation before the promotion, then obviously the avenue 
or pathway of proforma promotion comes into field for his rescue. 
If he lost his promotion on account of any administrative oversight 
or delay in the meeting of DPC or Selection Board despite having 
fitness, eligibility and seniority, then in all fairness, he has a 
legitimate expectation for proforma promotion with consequential 
benefits. The provision for proforma promotion is not alien or 
unfamiliar to the civil servant service structure but it is already 
embedded in Fundamental Rule 17, wherein it is lucidly 
enumerated that the appointing authority may, if satisfied that a 
civil servant who was entitled to be promoted from a particular 
date was, for no fault of his own, wrongfully prevented from 
rendering service to the Federation in the higher post, direct that 
such civil servant shall be paid the arrears of pay and allowances 
of such higher post through proforma promotion or upgradation 
arising from the antedated fixation of his seniority.  We often noted 
that unjustified delay in proforma promotion cases trigger severe 
hardship and difficulty for the civil servants and also creates 
multiplicity of litigation. It would be in the fitness of things that the 
competent authority should fix a timeline with strict observance for 
the designated committees of proforma promotions in order to 
ensure rational decisions on the matters expeditiously with its 
swift implementation, rather than dragging or procrastinating all 
such issues inordinately or without any rhyme or reasons which 
ultimately compels the retired employees to knock the doors of 
Courts of law for their withheld legitimate rights which could 
otherwise be granted to them in terms of applicable rules of service 
without protracted litigation or Court’s intervention.    
 
C.Ps.No.3157 to 3165/2022

7. The learned Tribunal has also referred to the Office 
Memorandum dated 7.10.1999 in which, according to the policy 
instructions of 1986, civil employees of the Federal Government 
were allowed to move-over to the next highest basic pay scale with 
effect from 1st December of the year following the year in which 
they reach the maximum. It was further mentioned in the same 
office 
memorandum 
that 
these 
instructions 
were 
inferred 
erroneously to imply one year’s stay at the maximum before 
entitlement to move-over, and the term “following year” used in the 
instructions of 1986 in fact means the next calendar year. When 
the present respondents were granted proforma promotion to BPS-
19 with effect from 29.12.1999 vide notification dated 15.01.2018, 
they had already reached the maximum stage of BPS-19, therefore, 
they were entitled to be moved-over to BPS-20. After considering 
the pros and cons, the learned Tribunal rightly set aside the 
decision of the Committee dated 31.7.2019, whereby the 
respondents were denied the benefit of move-over which was 
accrued to them before the date of proforma promotion. All factual 
and legal aspects have already been considered and dealt with by 
the book in the impugned judgment of the learned Tribunal.  
 
 
8. In the wake of the above discussion, we do not find any 
irregularity or perversity in the impugned judgment passed by the 
learned Tribunal. The Civil Petitions are dismissed and leave is 
refused.
