ORDER

We have before us three Constitution Petitions
eveliseitiene the vires of the Supreme Court (Review of
Judgements and Orders) Act, 2023 (“impugned Act”). The
primary contention of the petitioners is that the enlargement
of the scope of the review jurisdiction of the Court in matters
arising from proceedings under Article 184(3) of the
Constitution is made available on all grounds permitted in an
apieal. The conferment of appellate powers in the review
jurisdiction is tantamount to converting the remedy of review
into an appeal. Such merger of jurisdictions eliminates the
distinction between review and appeal jurisdictions created by
Article 188 and Article 185 of the Constitution which is
unconstitutional and void. The impugned Act amounts to
colourable legislation to effectuate a result that would require
a constitutional amendment. Further urged that the
impugned Act purports the same object and effect as the
Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure) Act, 2023 which is
already under challenge before the Court for providing the
remedy of appeal that transgresses the limits imposed in
Entry 55 of the Federal Legislative List (ref: Schedule IV to the
Constitution). The effect of the said law has been suspended

by a Larger Bench of this Court vide order dated 13.04.2023.

2. Issue notice to the respondents. Notice shall also be.

issued to the Attorney General for Pakistan under Order

ae

XXVIIA’ of the CPC, inter alia, on the above noted

constitutional questions raised for determination in these

petitions.

3. Syed Ali Zafar, learned ASC who is representing the
respondents in the review petition (C.R.P.No.17/2023), the
learned Attorney General: :' the learned counsel for the
review petitioner in CRP No. 17 of 2023, Election Commission
of Pakistan, the two petitioners in person all of whom have
assisted the Court today, agree that the aforementioned
pending review petition ought to be decided expeditiously as it
involves important constitutional points about the holding of
General Elections and in that context, the manner in which
the constitutional obligations envisaged in Article 224(2) read -

with Article 218(3) of the Constitution have to be discharged. ©

4. We therefore presently direct both matters to be listed

together (Constitution Petition Nos.21 to 23/2023 &

~ C.R.P.No.17/2023) on 13.06.2023 when the main effort

’ would be to proceed in a manner that the review petition is

decided expeditiously.
